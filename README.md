# Hotel Safe

One you launch the app. A default pin is set in the local storage of the brower.
The pin is set to "1234" initially.

Once you enter the pin and hit enter, the safe will be open.

During the open stage of the safe, you will be able to set a new pin to the safe.

Once you enter a new pin, the safe will be locked again. Further more you can only open the safe with the new pin you have set and the old pin (1234) will no longer work.
